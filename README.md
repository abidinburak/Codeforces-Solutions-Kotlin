Solutions to problems in Codeforces with Kotlin

Hello, I will solve 100 problems in Codeforces using Kotlin for 100 days.
I will try to upload a problem solution here every day.
Even after 100 problems, I will continue to upload solutions here whenever I get the chance.
I think this is a good way to learn Kotlin, you can contribute to me by commenting on the codes I wrote.
